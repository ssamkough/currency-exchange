# Currency Exchange 💱

An app that exchanges the user's currency to a currency of their choice. I'm using the [Exchange Rates API](http://exchangeratesapi.io/).

## Running Locally 🖍️

1. Install [nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Clone [git repo](https://github.com/ssamkough/currency-exchange).
3. Install dependencies via yarn: `yarn`.
4. Start react app via yarn: `yarn start`.
5. To test app is working correctly run: `yarn test`.
