# Currency Exchange 💱

An app that exchanges the user's currency to a currency of their choice. I am using the [Exchange Rates API](http://exchangeratesapi.io/).

## Implementation 🦄

All we need to use is one request:
`GET https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?symbols=USD,GBP HTTP/1.1`
This "requests specific exchange rates by setting the symbols parameter".

## Technology 📟

- N/A
